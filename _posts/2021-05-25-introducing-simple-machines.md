Now that it's summer, lets analyze and describe simple "machines."

In this project series I will work through several toy problems in which I characterize machine primitives and think through various ways to describe or simulate them.  

By doing this I hope to improve my mechanical intuitions, design vocabulary, get additional practice in analyzing machines, and have a little fun.
